/// Usage
/// This type receives as closures as parameters
/// By using this decorator you can add custom behaviour
/// to closures.
/// Like this sample:
/// When the closures of this type execute it will be wrapped
/// in the closure created by the decorator.
/// Example:
///  ```
///struct EquatableTypeHandler {
///    let canHandle: (Any, Any) -> Bool
///    let areEqual: (Any, Any) -> Bool
///
///    init(
///        canHandle: @escaping (Any, Any) -> Bool,
///        areEqual: @escaping (Any, Any) -> Bool
///    ) {
///        self.canHandle = closureDecorator(canHandle) { closure, a, b in
///            print("ðŸš¨ Checking if can handle ")
///            // Perform more stuff
///            return closure(a, b)
///        }
///
///        self.areEqual = closureDecorator(canHandle) { closure, a, b in
///            print("ðŸš¨ Checking if are equal ")
///            // Perform more stuff
///            return closure(a, b)
///        }
///    }
///}
///  ```
